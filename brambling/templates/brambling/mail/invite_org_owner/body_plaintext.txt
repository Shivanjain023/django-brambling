You've been invited to help manage an organization on Dancerfly!

{{ invite.user.first_name }} is running events for their organization, {{ content.name }}, on dancerfly.com,
and added you as an owner! That means you have access to all the
information and tools you need to give them a hand setting up
and running events for this organization, including the ability to
add new members to your team. The power... THE POWER!  ...ahem.
