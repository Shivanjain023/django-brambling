	<h2>Pricing</h2>

	<h1><small>We charge</small> 1.5% <small>of online payments.</small></h1>

	<p><em class='text-muted'>After the current beta ends, this will go up to 2.5%.</em></p>

	<p>
		<strong>Payment processors may charge additional fees.</strong>
		We currently support three payment methods: <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> (credit cards), <a href="http://dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>, and mailed checks.
		Any combination of these payment methods can be enabled for your event.
		Processing fees are as follows:
	</p>

	<h4>Stripe <a href="http://stripe.com/us/pricing/">2.9% + 30¢ on all transactions</a></h4>
	<h4>Dwolla <a href="http://dwolla.com/fees/">25¢ for transactions over $10</a></h4>

	<p>
		You must register for an account with Stripe or Dwolla if you choose to use them.
		Sales will go directly to you with the processing and facilitation fees automatically subtracted.
		We don't charge fees on check payments.
	</p>

	<p>
		We do not allow events to pass fees on to their attendees.
		This is because of a strong feeling on our part that the user's
		experience is more pleasant if there aren't any hidden costs.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have any questions, or if you believe you have a compelling reason
		to request a different rate / payment arrangement for your event, please
		get in touch with us via email at <a href="hello@littleweaverweb.com">hello@littleweaverweb.com</a>.
